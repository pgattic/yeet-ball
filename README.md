# Yeet Ball Mobile

This is the code for Yeet Ball's port to Android/iOS, written in HTML5, for compiling using PhoneGap/Cordova. 

The code was adapted from the web version a long time ago, so it is really outdated and slow! If I get back to this code ever again, it will probably be starting from scratch, and probably in a different language.

But anyway, here it is, in all its glory.
